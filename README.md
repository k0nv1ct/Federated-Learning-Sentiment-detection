# Sentiment Detection in Federated Learning Environment

This repository contains a project for sentiment detection in a federated learning environment. The goal of this project is to detect the sentiment of the user in real-time based on their keyboard input. The sentiment detection can be used to implement various applications such as customer satisfaction with data privacy or public safety by identifying individuals who may be experiencing depression and potentially at risk of self-harm. The project utilizes datasets from Reddit and Sentiment140.

## Dataset
The project utilizes datasets from two sources:
- Reddit: The Reddit dataset contains textual data extracted from Reddit posts and comments. It provides a diverse range of text samples with different sentiments.
- Sentiment140: The Sentiment140 dataset consists of labeled tweets, where each tweet is labeled as either positive or negative sentiment.

## Workflow
The project workflow can be summarized as follows:

1. Data Preprocessing: The Reddit and Sentiment140 datasets are preprocessed to clean the text data. This involves steps such as removing special characters, tokenizing, removing stop words, and handling any other necessary text cleaning tasks.

2. Federated Learning Setup: The project implements a federated learning setup, where the sentiment detection model is trained locally on individual devices or nodes while preserving data privacy. The federated learning framework is established using suitable libraries or frameworks.

3. Model Development: A sentiment detection model is developed using machine learning or deep learning techniques. This model is trained on the preprocessed data from the federated learning nodes.

4. Federated Learning Training: The sentiment detection model is trained in a federated learning environment. The model weights are shared and updated across the nodes, preserving data privacy and maintaining decentralized training.

5. Real-time Sentiment Detection: Once the model is trained, it can be deployed to detect the sentiment of users in real-time based on their keyboard input. The model processes the input text and predicts the sentiment, enabling applications such as customer satisfaction monitoring or early detection of individuals at risk.

6. Evaluation and Performance Metrics: The trained model's performance is evaluated using suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to accurately detect sentiment.

## Usage
To run the sentiment detection model in the federated learning environment, follow these steps:

1. Set up the environment by installing the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file that contains the step-by-step implementation of sentiment detection in a federated learning environment.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the dataset, set up the federated learning framework, develop the sentiment detection model, train the model in a federated learning environment, and deploy the model for real-time sentiment detection.

5. The notebook includes code snippets and explanations for each step to facilitate understanding and execution. Make sure to run each cell sequentially to ensure correct execution.
